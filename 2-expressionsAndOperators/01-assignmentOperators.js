//Assignment Operator
// the equal sign is an Assignment Operator
let r = 5;

// Addition Assignment Operator, can't use with strings, just variables.  Three ways, last best shortcut
r = r + 1;
r += 1;
r++;

// Subtraction Assignment Operator
r -= 7;
r --;

// -- or ++ only adds or subtracts a single value, not more

// Multiplication Assignment Operator

r *= 10;

//Division Assignment Operator

r /= 3;

// Exponent assignment operator, raise to the third power, as example
// ** = 2; square

r ** = 3;

//Modules assignment operator (example divide by 5, give the remainder)
//The remainder is the decimal from an uneven divide

r %= 5;
